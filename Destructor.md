# Exp.No:5B  Destructor
# AIM
To create a Python class Student with a destructor.

# ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Define the student class.
3. Inside the student class, define the init method (constructor) and the del method (destructor).
4. Create an object s2 of the student class. When the object s2 is created, the init method is called, and its print statements are executed.
5. Use the del statement to delete the object s2. This triggers the del method (destructor), and the respective print statements are executed.
6. Terminate the program.

# PROGRAM
Reg-212223060113 Name-Karnatam Bindu
```
class Awesome:
def greetings(self):
print("My name is Vishvajit Rao and I am 22 years old.")
def del(self):
print("Vishvajit Rao student is deleted.")
obj = Awesome()
obj.greetings()
```
